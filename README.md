# Front End Developer Journey

Through many attempts at "learning", yeah, we'll say that...I've become so exhausted with the constant procrastination on *what to learn and how..*
So here comes Scrimba, a way for me to finally have the enjoyment in learning that I've been seeking for. It's interactive, and it covers everything (so far) that i'd expect it to. 

We'll see how this learning journey goes, but for now, this will be where my code lives. In the eyes of the public ðŸ‘€
